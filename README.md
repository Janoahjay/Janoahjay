You wake up in a clearing surrounded by tall trees. The air feels thick with magic, and you can hear strange sounds echoing through the forest.
What would you like to do?

> Look around
You see three paths leading out of the clearing: one to the north, one to the east, and one to the west. Which path will you choose?

> Go east
You follow the path to the east and encounter a deep ravine blocking your way. There's a bridge spanning the gap, but it looks unstable.
What will you do?

> Inspect bridge
You notice that one of the bridge's support ropes is frayed. You search your inventory and find a length of sturdy rope.
What will you do?

> Use rope to reinforce bridge
You tie the rope around the weakened support, strengthening the bridge. Now, you can safely cross the ravine.
You continue on your journey deeper into the Enchanted Forest...
